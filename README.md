# Flask OpenAI Integration

This repository contains a Flask application designed to interact with the OpenAI API to provide responses to various prompts related to topics like horoscopes, clairvoyance, psychology, dream interpretation, and general inquiries.

## Overview

The application provides a web interface where users can submit questions in different categories, and the backend, powered by OpenAI's GPT model, generates responses. This application is a demonstration of integrating OpenAI's powerful language models with a web application.

## Features

- Web-based interface for user interaction
- Multiple endpoints representing different thematic areas
- Backend integration with OpenAI API
- Environment variable management for API keys
